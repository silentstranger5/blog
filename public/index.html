          <p>In the previous post, I&rsquo;ve discussed C language and briefly introduced how to used it. To be honest, if you have programming experience already, chances are that you can use most of the C without issues. There may be some problems with pointers though. Maybe I&rsquo;ll cover it in the next time.</p>
<p>When I described C, I said that it is simple language in itself, although it can be tricky to use because there is not much included in the language. Indeed, if you compare it to modern languages, there are many features lacking. I&rsquo;m not even telling about various containers and algorithms like lists, maps or sets.</p>

          <h2 id="c-language">C Language</h2>
<p>For some unknown reason, I often find myself drawn to C. It&rsquo;s hard for me to tell exactly why&hellip; Above all, I think that the most important reason is the simplicity of this language. It is fairly small and can be learned relatively fast. It is also very close to assembly with very close mapping between C code and assembly instructions.</p>
<p>Do not be fooled by this simplicity, though, reader. Even if the language and standard library are pretty minimal, and even if it is close enough to primitive instructions, this language is not simple to use.</p>

          <p>Some places around the world are essentially cut off from the Internet. I am talking about countries like Russia and China. This isolation is often a combination of restricted access from both outside (due to sanctions) and inside (due to censorship). In most cases, the reasons for such isolation are political.</p>
<p>I am not a politologist or sociologist, nor do I claim to be even remotely competent in such areas. As a citizen of such an isolated country, allow me to clarify that many (at least a significant part with a minimum of 30% of the population, especially those who live in big cities and have internet access) do not agree with political course of action. The rest of the people are either brainwashed by propaganda or completely indifferent and just trying to survive. In many cases, authorities are &ldquo;elected&rdquo; without consent, and the election is just for a show. Authorities use brute force and legal prosecution in order to suppress any opposition. Such terrorism is very effective in the oppression of the population. There is essentially nothing that can be done against unfair law that penalizes you with 10 years of prison or a gun near your head.</p>
